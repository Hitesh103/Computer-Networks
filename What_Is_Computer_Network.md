# Computer Networking Overview
This is a brief overview of computer networking, including what it is, how it works, and how it is evolving. We will also explore the different types of computer networks.

## What is Computer Networking?
Computer networking is the practice of connecting computing devices and IoT devices to communicate with one another. This is done through specialized devices such as switches, routers, and access points. Switches and access points connect devices to networks, while routers connect networks to other networks.

## How does a computer network work?
In a computer network, devices are identified using MAC and IP addresses. A MAC address is a number assigned to a device's network interface card (NIC) by its manufacturer, while an IP address is a number assigned to a network connection. The network is managed by specialized devices such as switches, routers, and access points. Modern networks are evolving to be more programmable, automated, and secure.

## How is computer networking evolving?
Computer networking is evolving to keep up with new requirements in the digital age. The different types of network architectures that are evolving include software-defined (SDN), intent-based (IBN), virtualized, controller-based, and multidomain integrations. Each of these architectures has its own strengths and is designed to meet specific requirements.

## Types of computer networks
There are different types of computer networks, including:

`Local-area network (LAN)` : A LAN is a collection of connected devices in one physical location, such as a home or an office. It can be small or large, and may include wired and wireless devices.

`Wide-area network (WAN)`: A WAN extends over a large geographical area and connects individual users or multiple LANs. The Internet can be considered a WAN.

`Enterprise network:` A network built for a large organization, typically called an enterprise, needs to be highly available, scalable, and robust. These networks may use both LANs and WANs.

`Service-provider network:` Service providers operate WANs to provide connectivity to individual users or organizations. They may offer simple connectivity, in the form of leased lines, or more advanced, managed services to enterprises.

This overview provides a basic understanding of computer networking and how it is evolving.
